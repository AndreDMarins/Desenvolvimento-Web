			<h2>Florida Students to Speak with NASA Astronaut Aboard International Space Station 1</h2>
			<p>
				University and high school students from Florida will have an opportunity to talk with a NASA astronaut on the International Space Station next week. The Earth-to-space call will air on NASA Television and the agency’s website.

				Anne McClain will answer questions from students at Florida Atlantic University and the Palm Beach County, Broward County, and Miami Dade school districts. The event will take place at 1:25 p.m. EST Tuesday, Feb. 19, at the Engineering East building of Florida Atlantic University’s Boca Raton campus, 777 Glades Road, Boca Raton. Media interested in covering should contact Lisa Metcalf at lmetcalf@fau.eduor 561-297-3022.

				Linking students directly to astronauts aboard the space station provides unique, authentic experiences designed to enhance student learning, performance and interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics.) Astronauts living in space on the orbiting laboratory communicate with NASA’s Mission Control Center in Houston 24 hours a day through the Space Network’sTracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS).
